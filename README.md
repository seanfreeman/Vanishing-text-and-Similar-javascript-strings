# Vanishing-text-and-Similar-javascript-strings

Fidle with these two projects on JSFIDDLE:

1. https://jsfiddle.net/00pxmjo1/

1. Write a javascript function to take in a String, and output "n" similar looking strings.

    Input : n = 5, String = "Hey New Yorkers"

    Output : ["Gay New Yorkers","Hey Mew Korkers","Hay New Yormers","Heg Nbw Yoikers","Hey Neu Yorkerd"]



2. Write a CSS class with a javascript function which observes a time "t" value, and as the value of t decreases the characters associated with the div start vanishing.

    Example :<div class="vanishing" >Hey New Yorkers</div>

    When t = 10, all the chars in "Hey New Yorkers" show

    the value of t decreases every second.

    Now, t=9, 10% of the random chars slowly vanish from "Hey New Yorkers"

    Now, t=8, another 10 % of the random chars vanish "He  New  orkers"

    Now t=7 , another 10 % vanish "He  Ne   or ers"

    and so on ...

    at t=0, all the chars vanished and nothing is shown in the div.
